##Error handling
This is a Solidity program for error handling.

## Description
Three methods are used for error handling:
1. require() - it validates the condition given. If condition is true then function is executed otherwise it passes the message back to caller.
2. revert() - if there is error it reverts the current call and returns to initial state. Remaining gas is returned to user.
3. assert() - it only validates the condition. If condition fails execution is terminated.


## Getting Started
  ##Executing Program
  To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., error.sol).
